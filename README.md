# html2latex
A java application and library to transform HTML into latex. this project is a fork by J. A. Parejo of the original HTML2Latex developed by jnnnnn, michalke, and srini88, available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/htmltolatex

The original app has been modified to support its use as a library in java. Now parsers can take as input an String with HTML content and return an String with Latex content.
